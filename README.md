Research/Project Questions: 
Who votes for the AKP party in Turkey? What factors drive the voting tendency in Turkey?

Literature Review  

Several explanations were proposed in the literature for the electoral success of AKP (Kumbaracibasi, 2009). One explanation proposes that the AKP success stems from the hypothesis that voters in Turkey are shifting to be more religious and socially conservative (Kumbaracibasi, 2009: 106). The second explanation is that voters were dissatisfied with the performance of other parties and previous governments (Kumbaracibasi, 2009). Of course, other factors play a role in shaping the voting behavior in Turkey such as gender, geography, economy, employment, education, and secularity. Though, it can be noticed that the center of debates about what explains the support for AKP is ideology. 

Ergun Ozbudun (2006) looks at the history of the votes of Islamist parties in parliamentary and general local elections and argues, based on supportive statistics, that AKP appears to be successful in “bringing together former center-right voters (conservatives), moderate Islamists, moderate nationalists, and even a certain segments of the former center-left (seculars) (Ozbudun, 2006: 546)”. He also argues that the AKP has successfully bridged the old-deep cleavage between secularists and Islamists contributing to the consolidation of democracy in Turkey (Ozbudun, 2006: 545-555). To address this qualitative approach of understanding the voting behavior in Turkey, several attempts were made to study different sets of control and independent variables through quantitative methods. 

Insofar, as the Turkish elections took place very recently on November 2015, no recent studies have attempted to investigate the validity of the hypothesis that religiosity can be the key explanatory factor for the support for AKP party in Turkey. However, similar works have investigated the reasons for the significant support for the AKP in the past decade. This will constitute the ground of this literature review, which can provide methodological insights for this project.  

Insightfully, Gurses (2012) provides a test for the inclusion-moderation hypothesis using the data on Turkey collected from the World Values Survey. He has conducted a regression analysis over the dataset from the 2007 World Values Survey (WUV) and interviews with elites from the AKP (Gurses, 2014). He aims to answer to what extent Islamists have moderated their views in order to obtain more mass. He has used the responses for “which party you would vote for” to encode the answers into (0:1) voters for Islamists, and for secularists (Gurses, 2014, p. 648). His control variables, income and education, define the social class within a scale of 8. The OLS regression is used to illuminate what factors account for the variation in the attitudes towards democracy. The religiousity variable was significant as it indicated that there is a negative relationship between this variable and attitudes toward democracy in the years 2000 and 2007 (Gurses, 2014, p. 651). 

Though, Baslevent and Akarca (2008) look more specifically in a micro-level on who voted for AKP in 2002. They aim at identifying the origins of the votes that the AKP has retrieved from the other opponent parties in order to segment the votes of those parties and their appeal movement (Baslevent & Akarca, 2008). They argue that the ideological factors were significant in shifting the voters from left parties to the right (pro-Islamist) party (the AKP). They draw the data from a survey conducted shortly after the 2002 elections that mainly addressed the voters’ socio-demographic features and their ideological tendencies (Baslevent & Akarca, 2008, p. 3). The significance of their work is that they considered the cases where a voter cast his ballot for the AKP in a framework in which all other factors are controlled for (Baslevent & Akarca, 2008, p. 7). To grasp on the variables that represent the choices of the voters, they have estimated two preliminary regressions: the tendency of a voter to cast his ballot for the AKP, and the links between the probability to vote for AKP and other variables (gender, age, education, place of ideological spectrum, degree of religiosity, and optimism for the economy future). A third regression was used to measure the likelihood of voting for the AKP through a function of all variables of the first two regressions, and to render the coefficients of insignificant variables of age and religiosity. 

As the ideological factors seem to be the heart of the literature body, Kalaycioglu (2008) provides empirical tests for the current hypotheses in the literature. Four independent variables have centered of the test: the role of parents’ party identification, ideological orientations, economic expectations, and ethnic identities of voters (Kalaycioglu, 2008). He argues that ideology seems to play the major role in determining the psychological orientations of voters towards the different parties. The data were retrieved from a 2007 national survey of a target sample of 2000 respondent. The findings state that religiosity plays a significant role in shaping the voting behavior in Turkey, and it is centered at the freedom of conscience, faith in religion, and Shari’a rule in Turkey (Kalaycioglu, 2008).  

Nevertheless, Carkoglu (2006, 2009, 2011) argues that the Turkish elections high fragmentation and electoral volatility have been misinterpreted as the lack of competition does not make a party dominant (Carkoglu, 2011, p. 44). He argues, instead, that because of the geographical distribution and the weak independent candidates as well as the ideological manifestation, the AKP became successful of obtaining the highest number of votes. Manifesting the votes’ distribution on several scatter plots and through spatial analysis, Carkoglu stresses that the geographical factor plays a major role. However, when comparing his findings with the 2015 elections results, the geographical belongingness can be debated and seems not to provide sufficient explanations of the support for AKP. 

In an attempt to see what affects the Turkish foreign policy, Dickenson (2012) has looked at the public affiliation to the Turkish parties. Using the Pew Global Attitudes Project, Dickenson tries to see how the Turkish policy is shifting towards the “Axis Theory”, turning away from the West. He tackles the question if the AKP’s Islamism is radicalizing the Turkish public, by using confirmatory factor analysis to estimate the underlying latent variable (Eastern, Islamic or Western Orientation), utilized through a multiple indicator multiple cause (MIMIC) model (Dickenson, 2012, p. 7). He includes eight covariates in the MIMIC models: the first three reflects respondents’ affiliation to Turkish parties, and the rest reflects demographic variables (e.g. gender, income, and religiosity) on a seven-point scale. The findings suggest that, based on the 2011 elections’ results, Turkey is not shifting towards the Axis, but rather towards more autonomy. 

Before the 2009 electoral elections, Akacra (2009) has made an attempt to predict the AKP’s nationwide vote share for the elections of 2009 based on historical patterns rather than poll data (Akarca, 2009). The prediction aims at explaining the Turkish voter behavior. The model he presents captures the main tendencies exhibited by the voters according to the literature. The regression explains 96 percent of the variation in the vote share of the major incumbent party, and all estimated coefficients are statistically significant at conventional levels. The study shows that at the root of the relatively short tenures of Turkish governments, their frequent indulgence in populist policies, and the frequency of elections that are called sooner than their time lie the behavior of the Turkish electorate. What is significant is as this model forecasts a 6.6 percentage point drop in the vote share of the AKP, under the assumption that typical historical patterns would occur, the 2015 elections results falls in the range of the prediction. 

Based on this review of the literature, the most important variables that affect the dependant variable of political affiliation are: age, sex, ideology, education, employment, geography, and political beliefs. However, it seems that there is almost a consensus that ideology is the key factor that significantly direct and influence the political affiliation of voters.

We can describe the voters of AKP party in Turkey are predicted to be religious married +30years who are ethnically Turkish and ideologically rightists, with middle to high income and mostly living in east of Turkey. 
Models Scores & Results: 
The R-squared of initial OLS regression was around 0.15 and some variables held insignificant P-Values. Thus, classification models reflected better performance results and predication accuracies. 
The best classification score came by Random Forest Model enhanced with Gridsearch at 0.61. This is just slightly more than KNN-gridsearched with 0.60 and SVM-gridsearched with 0.59. For further details of the best parameters for each gridsearch, see blow:
